<hr />

<p><a href="https://genuary.art/" target="\_blank"> Genuray</a> is an artificially generated month
of time where we build code that makes beautiful visualizations. This year, I participated in
4 days of this month with the aim of visualizing 5 minutes of my resting-state brain signal,
as recorded by an electroencephalogram (EEG). Every day, another prompt is provided by the
organizers. The rest is just creativity. It is the first year that I am participating and I
just started learning TouchDesigner.</p>

<h1 id="day-1-perfect-loop">Day 1: Perfect loop</h1>

<p>For day 1, I got inspired by a Moebius strip, which builds an infinite loop.
Adding towards this, this Moebius strip contains some EEG spectrogram, visualizing power over frequencies.</p>

<h1 id="day-2-made-in-10-minutes">Day 2: Made in 10 minutes</h1>
<p>The topic was less than 10 minutes, but it rather took me an hourâ€¦
The turning sculpture inside the visual is a combination of 90 channels of raw brain data, projected to three dimensions.</p>

<h1 id="day-3-glitch-art">Day 3: Glitch Art</h1>
<p>How would brain data look like if every recording channel would be interpreted as a colour value ? I used 3 brain electrodes as r, g and b values to define a colour and visualized a total of 100 brain electrodes</p>

<h1 id="day-4-intersections">Day 4: Intersections</h1>
<p>How about a ball rolling in a space of EEG? Why not!</p>

<h1 id="day-11-suprematism">Day 11: Suprematism</h1>
<p>An unusual way to visualize brain data,  but this is how an EEG spectrogram could look like in the style of Suprematism.
It contains 1 min of brain data. The size of the shapes corresponds to power in different frequency bands.</p>
