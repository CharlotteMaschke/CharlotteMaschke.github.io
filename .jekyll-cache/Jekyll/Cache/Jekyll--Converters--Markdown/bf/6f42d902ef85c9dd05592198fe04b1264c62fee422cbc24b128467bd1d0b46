<p>My particular challenge for this year: using some of my brainâ€™s data to make visualizations
for every dayâ€™s topic. Here are some examples:</p>

<h2 id="day-1-perfect-loop">Day 1: Perfect loop</h2>

<p>For day 1, I got inspired by a Moebius strip, which builds an infinite loop.
Adding towards this, this Moebius strip contains some EEG spectrogram, visualizing power over frequencies.</p>

<h2 id="day-2-made-in-10-minutes">Day 2: Made in 10 minutes</h2>
<p>The topic was less than 10 minutes, but it rather took me an hourâ€¦
The turning sculpture inside the visual is a combination of 90 channels of raw brain data, projected to three dimensions.</p>

<h2 id="day-3-glitch-art">Day 3: Glitch Art</h2>
<p>How would brain data look like if every recording channel would be interpreted as a colour value ? I used 3 brain electrodes as r, g and b values to define a colour and visualized a total of 100 brain electrodes</p>
