<h2 id="idea-for-a-science-art-competition">Idea for a science-art competition:</h2>
<p>I participated in a Science-art competition to honor <a href="https://eeg100.org/" target="\_blank">100 years of EEG</a>. 
My idea was to use EEG waves to draw portraits of scientists. In the example above, I tried it with my own portrait and one channel of my own recorded brain waves.</p>

<p>Below, you find the link to the Girhub repo with code and examples.</p>
