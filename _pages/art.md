## Genuary2023 - making generative art throughout January
My particular challenge for this year: using some of my brain's data to make visualizations
for every day's topic. Here are some examples:

## Day 1: Perfect loop

For day 1, I got inspired by a Moebius strip, which builds an infinite loop.
Adding towards this, this Moebius strip contains some EEG spectrogram, visualizing power over frequencies.

## Day 2: Made in 10 minutes
The topic was less than 10 minutes, but it rather took me an hour...
The turning sculpture inside the visual is a combination of 90 channels of raw brain data, projected to three dimensions.

## Day 3: Glitch Art
How would brain data look like if every recording channel would be interpreted as a colour value ? I used 3 brain electrodes as r, g and b values to define a colour and visualized a total of 100 brain electrodes
