## Short Bio
Fascination for the vast mysteries of the human mind was the reason why I started my undergraduate studies in psychology, as well as philosophy at Technical University Dresden, Germany. A research internship in the institute for brain and mind science at National Taiwan University strengthened my intention to pursue graduate studies in a highly research focused neuroscience program. At the same time, I discovered a genuine motivation for computer science. I realized that the symbiotic relation between neuroscience and artificial intelligence is one of the greatest chances to advance in science and to develop future-leading technologies. Beyond this, I always kept my passion for philosophy and art.
