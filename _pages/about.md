## Short Bio
I completed my PhD in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience at McGill University, Canada working on identifying brain signatures of consciousness in unresponsive patients. My PhD research focused on the development of a clinical tool to quantify capacity for consciousness following brain injury, using anesthetic perturbation and brain dynamical properties. I is currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard Medical School and Aix-Marseille University, using whole-brain modelling for epilepsy treatment simulation. My work gravitates around the concept of complex dynamics as a requirement for healthy brain function and the emergence of consciousness. Beyond my regular research, I am  passionate about the intersection between science and art.
