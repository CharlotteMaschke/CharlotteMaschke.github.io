## Short Bio
I did my undergraduate studies in psychology at Technical University Dresden, Germany. A research internship in the institute for brain and mind science at National Taiwan University strengthened my intention to pursue graduate studies in a highly research focused neuroscience program. At the same time, I discovered a genuine motivation for computer science. I realized that the symbiotic relation between neuroscience and artificial intelligence is one of the greatest chances to advance in science and to develop future-leading technologies. Beyond this, I always kept my passion for philosophy and art. In 2019, I started my Masters studies at McGill University, Montreal Canada in the [BIAPT Lab](https://www.moraeslab.com/biapt/){:target="\_blank"}. In 2024 I received a PhD in neuroscience from McGill university.
