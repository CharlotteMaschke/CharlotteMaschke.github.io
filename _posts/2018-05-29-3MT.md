# Do you want a summary of my research in 3 minutes?
In April 2022, I participated in the three minute thesis contest at McGill University. From around 150 initial participants, 15 were selected for the finals.
My talk won the 3rd prize!

My talk summarizes one of our current research projects. We record the electroencephalographic (EEG) brain response of patients in the intensive care unit. Upon arrival at the intensive care unit, most patients are under continuous sedation. This state is usually referred to artificial coma.

<br>

Once a day, the sedation is stopped for a couple of minutes. During this time the nurse assesses the patient's level of consciousness. While most patients start behaviourally reacting and interacting, some patients remain behaviourally unresponsive. In this case, the patients level of consciousness and potential to recover remain elusive.

In my research, we record the EEG brain response during the short interruption of sedation to quantify patient's potential to emerge and sustain consciousness and to predict long-term cognitive and functional development.
