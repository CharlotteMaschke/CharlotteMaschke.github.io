### Genuary 2023

---

[ Genuray](https://genuary.art/){:target="\_blank"} is an artificially generated month
of time where we build code that makes beautiful visualizations. This year, I participated in
4 days of this month with the aim of visualizing 5 minutes of my resting-state brain signal,
as recorded by an electroencephalogram (EEG). Every day, another prompt is provided by the
organizers. The rest is just creativity. It is the first year that I am participating and I
just started learning TouchDesigner.


# Day 1: Perfect loop

For day 1, I got inspired by a Moebius strip, which builds an infinite loop.
Adding towards this, this Moebius strip contains some EEG spectrogram, visualizing power over frequencies.

# Day 2: Made in 10 minutes
The topic was less than 10 minutes, but it rather took me an hour...
The turning sculpture inside the visual is a combination of 90 channels of raw brain data, projected to three dimensions.

# Day 3: Glitch Art
How would brain data look like if every recording channel would be interpreted as a colour value ? I used 3 brain electrodes as r, g and b values to define a colour and visualized a total of 100 brain electrodes

# Day 4: Intersections
How about a ball rolling in a space of EEG? Why not!

# Day 11: Suprematism
An unusual way to visualize brain data,  but this is how an EEG spectrogram could look like in the style of Suprematism.
It contains 1 min of brain data. The size of the shapes corresponds to power in different frequency bands.
