# EEG to Portrait
---

## Idea for a science-art competition: 
I participated in a Science-art competition to honor [100 years of EEG](https://eeg100.org/){:target="\_blank"}. 
My idea was to use EEG waves to draw portraits of scientists. In the example above, I tried it with my own portrait and one channel of my own recorded brain waves.

Below, you find the link to the Girhub repo with code and examples.
